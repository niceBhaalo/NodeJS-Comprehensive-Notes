# Introduction

These are going to be comprehensive programming notes not written in any specific order. Instead I will add standalone topics about things that I have used but don't really fully understand. The goal is to reduce the technical debt. I will add articles covering What, How, and Why of the various topics and see where it takes me. 
Areas I aim to cover are;
- NodeJS
- Python
- React
- NextJS
- MongoDB

Hope this helps.

## NodeJS
### Module 0 - Setting Up
Module 0 is about Setting Up Git. Will add to it later on with fundamentals on git commands. 

### Module 1 - The Prerequisites
Module 1 is about knowing how callback functions, promises, async await, and basic error handling works
so that when you start to use actual NodeJS modules, you know how the flow of execution between the various
asynchronous code blocks. The idea is to get you prepared for the first proper server you can make.

### Module 2 - HTTP Module Part 1
Introduction to HTTP and http and https modules. Implementing http.request. Knowing inheritance of classes 
like IncomingMessage, Readable, Stream, EventEmitter. 

## Python
## React
## NextJS
## MongoDB

# Introduction

These are going to be comprehensive NodeJS notes divided into modules and lessons with tests 
about how to use NodeJS. It is going to start from the very beginning to as advanced as I can get. 

I love to teach and I also learn myself by teaching. So the goal is to make a massive repository that others
can use to structure their learning of NodeJS.
